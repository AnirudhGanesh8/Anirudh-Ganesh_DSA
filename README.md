*C Programming Projects Repository Welcome to the C Programming Projects Repository! This repository showcases a diverse collection of projects and mini-projects implemented in C, designed to explore and demonstrate various fundamental and advanced programming concepts. Whether you are a beginner learning the basics of C programming or an experienced developer looking to deepen your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and practical applications, this repository offers something for everyone.

*Introduction Programming in C forms the backbone of many software systems and applications due to its efficiency, flexibility, and wide-ranging capabilities. This repository serves as a resource for enthusiasts and learners alike to delve into a wide array of programming challenges and solutions, spanning from basic operations to complex problem-solving techniques.

*What's Inside? The repository covers a comprehensive range of topics, each represented by its own project or mini-project:

*Basic Operations and Algorithms: Includes projects like determining prime numbers, temperature state checking, and matrix operations.

*Data Structures: Explore implementations of stacks, queues, linked lists (singly, doubly, and circular), trees (including traversal algorithms), and hashing techniques.

*Advanced Algorithms: Dive into sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort), searching techniques (linear and binary search), and recursive algorithms (e.g., Tower of Hanoi).

*Expression Evaluation: Learn about evaluating postfix, prefix, and infix expressions, showcasing stack-based computation techniques.

*Mini Project - Travel's Planner - implementation in C, demonstrating interactive console-based logic handling.
